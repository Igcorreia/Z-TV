# Everything as Netflix

### Welcome üëã

This is [probably] purely an exercise to try to develop any interface like Netflix.
Since I am building v2.0 things may change.

## üñ•Ô∏è Target OS

The target is Chrome 48 which is used by a lot of Samsung Smart TVs

### üëâ Interactivity

Use number 2,4,6,8 to navigate in you TV Browser:

[1] **[2]** [3]

**[4]** [5] **[6]**

[7] **[8]** [9]

- 2 UP (Arrow Up)
- 4 Left (Arrow Left)
- 6 right (Arrow Right)
- 8 down (Arrow Down)

# Rules and Limitations

- Browser CSS and JS rules from Chrome 48 ( linear-gradient does not work)
- Touch the DOM as minimum as possible
- Sart Animation only after content and images are loaded
- Load everything on GPU
- Make it as dynamic as possible, data source should be enough to change everything
- Use a modern stack like Webpack, Babel, etc (type=module does not work)
- Fade Animation
- Different Type of Scrollers
